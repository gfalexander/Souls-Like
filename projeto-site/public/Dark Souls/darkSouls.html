                <span>
                    The world of Dark Souls is a world of cycles. Kingdoms rise and fall, ages come and go, and even
                    time can end and restart as the flame fades and is renewed. These cycles are linked to the First
                    Flame, a mysterious manifestation of life that divides and defines separate states such as heat
                    and
                    cold, or life and death. As the First Flame fades, these differences also begin to fade, such as
                    life and death having little distinction, and humans becoming Undead. The onset of an Age of
                    Dark,
                    the time when the First Flame has fully died, is marked by endless nights, rampant undeath,
                    time,
                    space, and reality breaking down, lands collapsing and converging on one another, people
                    mutating
                    into monsters, darkness covering the world, and the Gods losing their power. To avoid this and
                    prolong the Age of Fire, the bearer of a powerful soul must "link" themselves to the First
                    Flame,
                    becoming the fuel for another age. If this is not done, the First Flame will eventually die, and
                    an
                    Age of Dark will begin.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The powerful Lord Souls were taken from the First Flame, used to defeat the dragons, and then to
                    establish kingdoms. Souls are inextricably (and inexplicably) linked to fire. Souls are life,
                    and
                    life is fire; it stands to reason that souls are fire, as well. Without the First Flame and
                    without
                    souls, there is no life. The bearer of a strong soul, called a Lord, who links themselves to the
                    First Flame, is thus rekindling the flames with their own soul, returning life to it. In the
                    end,
                    one could expect that all souls will have been returned to the First Flame, and the Age of Fire
                    will
                    have effectively ended anyways.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is inevitable that people try to find a way around this, another way to continue the Age of
                    Fire
                    without making sacrifices, but in every case they fail. In the first Age of Fire, the Witch of
                    Izalith attempted to create a duplicate of the First Flame using her witchcraft and a special
                    soul,
                    but failed catastrophically. Instead of making another First Flame, she had created a twisted
                    Flame
                    of Chaos that produced distortions of life, turning herself and all her daughters into demons.
                    These
                    demons were malevolent, and wandered the land. Gwyn gathered up his armies and fought the demons
                    of
                    Chaos, eventually driving them back and shackling the Bed of Chaos to bind them. Knowing that
                    the
                    Age of Fire was nearing its end, under the guidance of the primordial serpent Kingseeker Frampt,
                    Gwyn offered himself to the First Flame to stave off the Dark. As the flames surged with new
                    life,
                    the knights who followed him in were burnt by the flames and now wander the world as the Black
                    Knights, hollow shells of armor who attack indiscriminately.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Before he left to link the First Flame, Gwyn gave fragments of his soul to his followers and
                    allies.
                    Ornstein, Gough, Ciaran, and Artorias, his four strongest knights who fought against the
                    dragons,
                    Seath the Paledrake, who betrayed the dragons and played a crucial role in the war, and was also
                    granted the title of Duke and permission to build a grand archive to conduct his research, and
                    the
                    Four Kings of New Londo, who ruled a city of Undead. In time, another primordial serpent
                    convinced
                    the people of the human kingdom of Oolacile to delve into the darkness of the Abyss to unearth
                    the
                    grave of an ancient human. Whether through their actions or some other means, the primordial
                    human -
                    Manus - was resurrected and driven to madness, and his wild Humanity caused the people of
                    Oolacile
                    to mutate into abominations. Manus, Father of the Abyss, began to rapidly spread Dark and
                    accelerate
                    the growth of the Abyss, and would've started an early Age of Dark had he not been defeated.
                    Even
                    so, the kingdom of Oolacile was lost to the Abyss, and eventually forgotten in the modern day.
                    Nothing remains in the present day to mark the passing of this land save for Dusk, the princess
                    of
                    Oolacile.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Gwyn's youngest son Gwyndolin, together with Kingseeker Frampt, sheperds the humans by Gwyn's
                    command. Together they built giant asylums to house the countless undead, hoping against hope
                    that
                    one of them would be chosen to defeat the Asylum demon, and fulfill their destiny. The Undead
                    are
                    sent on a quest to ring the Bells of Awakening, collect the Lordvessel, slay the bearers of
                    Gwynn's
                    soul, then offer those souls to the Lordvessel to open the path to the Kiln of the First Flame.
                    In
                    doing so, the unnatural Undead are given true death and the living can enjoy another age of fire
                    for
                    a thousand years, while the Undead linked to the First Flame will continue to burn, alive and
                    aware,
                    until someone else comes to take their place. And thus, the cycle continues.
